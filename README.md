# README

This repository contains exercise files for the Girlcode JavaScript workshop 2

**ALL** code should be formatted with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode). If you do not do this, I will find you.

This repo will be using trunk based development on master. Please use `git pull --rebase` when pulling code, so your local repo changes will be applied to origin changes like a hat, no merges allowed.
